Simulation environment for any AI system.

## Usage

See ```__main__.py``` for the implemenable functions:

```
on_load() - Runs only once at the beggining.
on_behave() - Runs in each behave loop.
on_perceive() - Runs in each perceive loop.
```

After implementation you can run your own ```__main__.py``` file with:

```$ python .```

Or you can run the ```example.py``` file to see what the project could do currently.
